#TODO Make a docker instance
# Create a low hard drive space mode where when searching for lets say @gmail.com it would decompress 'a.tar.zst' search it and then recompress it after its done
# this way only one archive is decompressed at a time
#
# Add option for outputting meta data to console for queries besides @gamil
# have multiple log files for different storage places 
# Maybe try to use cython to speed up import
# use only dirs that are not compressed in byte statistics comprress.sh
# Export all data to a create sql file
# Option to choose certain dirs to check for @gmail.com
# Automatically find the amount of lines in import using wc
# have a check to make sure a file  exists before compressing or decompressing.sh

    This function takes in the line of the current file and the root path to the BaseQuery directory. Checks the format
